This is my personal waybar configuration in calOS, forked over from the great mechabar (https://github.com/sejjy/mechabar)

### Features

* Integrates with Walker via the top left (to launch system settings) and the middle (to launch the system applications).
* The middle of the waybar helps monitor your system specs (such as temperature, RAM, CPU usage, etc.)
* Your right portion of the waybar interacts with audio (play, pause, next, volume control) and utilizes bluetui + impala for connnectivity controls.
* A system update script lives in the top right as well, click on it to check for updates. Will periodically browse pacman repos + AUR to check if updates are available.
